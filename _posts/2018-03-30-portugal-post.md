Are you always craving something sugary to satisfy your sweet tooth? Portugal is
the place for you! Portugal is known for tasty pastries!

Bordering Spain, is the country of Portugal.  I had the experience of visiting
the nations capital, Lisbon.

Europe is known for the small and windy streets that are lined with vibrant
shops and quaint restaurants. What I saw in Portugal was exactly that!
