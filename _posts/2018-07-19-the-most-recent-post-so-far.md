Niagara Falls

![Niagara Falls Photo](/images/niagraFalls1.jpg)

Located on the border of Ontario, Canada and New York, USA lays a breathtaking
176 ft waterfall. This photo is taken from underneath the falls by walking
through a cave.

As we were only yards away from the water, we wore rain ponchos to stay dry!
For those who wanted a closer look, you can see the tour boat through the mist
that allowed visitors to be right up against the rapids.
