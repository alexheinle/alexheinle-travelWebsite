### **Italy**

As you explore Italy, you'll stand face-to-face with some of the world's most
iconic images from this 2,000 year history.

One of the most popular historial landmarks stands: *The Colosseum*

After, as as tourist in Italy, you will need to visit the **Roman Forum**

The Roman Forum is land filled with ancient ruins of government buildings that
were once built in the center of Rome.

As you walk through the forum, there are many informational plaques that explain
each ruin. It is amazing to think of how old the buildings are!

This unique fountain is the largest designed fountain in the city.

*Fair Warning* -- This attraction sight is very busy and crowded. The photo below
shows the large amount of people that gather around to gaze at the fountain.
Even though it is crowded and loud, IT IS WORTH IT!

Walking through the streets of Italy is a sightseeing attraction in its own!
The small and decorated streets and alley ways are old and unique! Sometimes you
will even find a delicious pizzaria.
